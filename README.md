# VueTestProject
School project. Learning the basics of Vue.js and presenting an easy code example for class.
I made a shopping list (no local storage though).


# To Run project

## Project setup

Write this in the terminal FIRST TIME you want to run the project:
```
npm  install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

Then write this in the terminal:
```
npm run serve
```
and copy http://localhost:8080/ to the address bar to open project in browser window and get live-updates.

You need to run npm serve once and copy link everytime you open the project to get live-update in browser.


Any problems?
check: https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html
(I'm not sure if you need to install Vue globally ("npm install -g @vue/cli"
)for "npm install" to work, but probably you don't have to do that. "npm install" should work)
